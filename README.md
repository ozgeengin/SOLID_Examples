# Simple SOLID principle examples written in C#

**SRP (The single-responsibility principle)**: There should never be more than one reason for a class to change. In other words, every class should have only one responsibility.

**OCP (The openâ€“closed principle)**: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

**LSP (The Liskov substitution principle)**: Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

**ISP (The interface segregation principle)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.

**DIP (The dependency inversion principle)**: High level modules should not depend on low level modules. both should depend on abstractions.
Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
